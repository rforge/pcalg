Title: Estimation of CPDAG/PAG and causal inference using the IDA algorithm
Description: Standard and robust estimation of the equivalence class of a
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the PC-Algorithm. The equivalence
    class is represented by its (unique) Complete Partially Directed
    Acyclic Graph (CPDAG). Furthermore, a PAG instead of a CPDAG can be
    estimated if latent variables and/or selection variables are assumed
    to be present. FCI and RFCI are available for estimating
    PAGs. Functions for causal inference using the IDA 
    algorithm (based on do-calculus of Judea Pearl) are provided for CPDAGs.
