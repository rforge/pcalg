Title: Estimation of CPDAG/PAG and causal inference using the IDA algorithm
Description: Standard and robust estimation of the equivalence class of a
       Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the PC-Algorithm. The equivalence
       class is represented by its (unique) Completetd Partially Directed
       Acyclic Graph (CPDAG). Furthermore, a PAG instead of a CPDAG can be
       estimated if latent variables and/or selection variables are assumed
       to be present. Functions for causal inference using the IDA
       algorithm (based on do-calculus of Judea Pearl) are provided for CPDAGs.
