\title{Class "fciAlgo"}
\description{The object contains the results of a call of the function
  \code{\link{fciAlgo}}.}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("fciAlgo", ...)} or
by a call of the function \code{\link{fciAlgo}}.
}
\section{Slots}{
	 \describe{
    \item{\code{amat}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"} which contains
      the adjacency matrix that was estimated. The edgemarks are coded
      by numbers: 0 - no edge, 1 - circle, 2 - arrowhead, 3 -
      arrowtail. If amat[i,j] = a and amat[j,i] = b, this represents the
    edge i b-a j, e.g., if a=1 and b=2 this represents i <-o j.}
    \item{\code{call}:}{Object of class \code{"call"} which contains the
    original call}
    \item{\code{n}:}{Object of class \code{"integer"}; number of samples
    that were used to estimate the graph}
    \item{\code{max.ord}:}{Object of class \code{"integer"}; maximum
      size of neighbourhood set that was conditioned on during the algorithm }
    \item{\code{n.edgetests}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}; number
      of edge tests that were performed }
    \item{\code{sepset}:}{Object of class \code{"list"}; the
      conditioning sets that made an edge drop out during the run of the
      algorithm}
    \item{\code{pMax}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"}; contains at
      entry ij the maximum p-Value of all conditional independence tests
      of edge ij}
    \item{\code{zMin}:}{Object of class \code{"matrix"}; contains at
      entry ij the minimum z-Value of all conditional independence tests
      of edge ij}
  }
}
\section{Methods}{
  \describe{
    \item{plot}{\code{signature(x = "fciAlgo")}: Plot the resulting
      undirected graph}
    \item{show}{\code{signature(object = "fciAlgo")}: Show properties of
      the fitted object}
    \item{summary}{\code{signature(object = "fciAlgo")}: Show details of
      the fitted object }
