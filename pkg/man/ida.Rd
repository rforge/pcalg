\details{
  It is assumed that we have observational data that are multivariate
  Gaussian and faithful to the true (but unknown) underlying causal DAG
  (without hidden variables).  Under these assumptions, this function
  estimates the multiset of possible total causal effects of \code{x} on
  \code{y}, where the total causal effect is defined via Pearl's
  do-calculus as \eqn{E(Y|do(X=z+1))-E(Y|do(X=z))} (this value does not
  depend on \eqn{z}, since Gaussianity implies that conditional
  expectations are linear).

  We estimate a \emph{set} of possible total causal effects instead of
  the unique total causal effect, since it is typically impossible to
  identify the latter when the true underlying causal DAG is unknown
  (even with an infinite amount of data).  Conceptually, the method
  works as follows.  First, we estimate the equivalence class of DAGs
  that describe the conditional independence relationships in the data,
  using the function \code{\link{pc}} (see the help file of this
  function).  For each DAG G in the equivalence class, we apply Pearl's
  do-calculus to estimate the total causal effect of \code{x} on
  \code{y}.  This can be done via a simple linear regression: if \code{y}
  is not a parent of \code{x}, we take the regression coefficient of
  \code{x} in the regression \code{lm(y ~ x + pa(x))}, where
  \code{pa(x)} denotes the parents of \code{x} in the DAG G; if \code{y}
  is a parent of \code{x} in G, we set the estimated causal effect to
  zero.

  If the equivalence class contains \code{k} DAGs, this will yield
  \code{k} estimated total causal effects.  Since we do not know which DAG
  is the true causal DAG, we do not know which estimated total causal
  effect of \code{x} on \code{y} is the correct one.  Therefore, we return
  the entire multiset of \code{k} estimated effects (it is a multiset
  rather than a set because it can contain duplicate values).

  One can take summary measures of the multiset.  For example, the
  minimum absolute value provides a lower bound on the size of the true
  causal effect: If the minimum absolute value of all values in the
  multiset is larger than one, then we know that the size of the true
  causal effect (up to sampling error) must be larger than one.

  If \code{method="global"}, the method as described above is carried
  out, where all DAGs in the equivalene class of the estimated CPDAG
  \code{graphEst} are computed using the function \code{\link{allDags}}.
  This method is suitable for small graphs (say, up to 10 nodes).

  If \code{method="local"}, we do not determine all DAGs in the
  equivalence class of the CPDAG.  Instead, we only consider the local
  neighborhood of \code{x} in the CPDAG.  In particular, we consider all
  possible directions of undirected edges that have \code{x} as
  endpoint, such that no new v-structure is created.  For each such
  configuration, we estimate the total causal effect of \code{x} on
  \code{y} as above, using linear regression.

  At first sight, it is not clear that such a local configuration
  corresponds to a DAG in the equivalence class of the CPDAG, since it
  may be impossible to direct the remaining undirected edges without
  creating a directed cycle or a v-structure.  However, Maathuis,
  Kalisch and Buehlmann (2009) showed that there is at least one DAG in
  the equivalence class for each such local configuration.

  As a result, it follows that the multisets of total causal effects of
  the "global" and the "local" method have the same unique values. They
  may, however, have different multiplicities.

  For example, a CPDAG may represent eight DAGs, and the global method
  may produce the multiset \{1.3, -0.5, 0.7, 1.3, 1.3, -0.5, 0.7, 0.7\}.
  The unique values in this set are -0.5, 0.7 and 1.3, and the
  multiplicities are 2, 3 and 3.  The local method, on the other hand,
  may yield \{1.3, -0.5, -0.5, 0.7\}.  The unique values are again -0.5,
  0.7 and 1.3, but the multiplicities are now 2, 1 and 1.  The fact that
  the unique values of the multisets of the "global" and "local" method
  are identical implies that summary measures of the multiset that only
  depend on the unique values (such as the minimum absolute value) can
  be estimate by the local method.
